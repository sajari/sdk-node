/**
 * Search.io API
 * Search.io offers a search and discovery service with NeuralsearchÂ®, the world\'s first instant AI search technology. Businesses of all sizes use Search.io to build site search and discovery solutions that maximize e-commerce revenue, optimize on-site customer experience, and scale their online presence.  # Authentication <!-- ReDoc-Inject: <SecurityDefinitions> -->  # Rate limiting  The Search.io API employs a number of safeguards against bursts of incoming traffic to help maximize its stability. Users who send many requests in quick succession may see error responses that show up as HTTP status code `429`.  For the [UpsertRecord](/docs/api#operation/UpsertRecord) call, Search.io allows up to 175 write operations per second.  Treat these limits as maximums and don\'t generate unnecessary load. See [Handling limiting gracefully](/docs/api/#section/Rate-limiting/Handling-limiting-gracefully) for advice on handling `429`s.  We may reduce limits to prevent abuse.  ## Common causes and mitigations  Rate limiting can occur under a variety of conditions, but it\'s most common in these scenarios:  - Running a large volume of closely-spaced requests. Often this is part of a user\'s long-running reindex job. When engaging in these activities, you should try to control the request rate (see [Handling limiting gracefully](/docs/api/#section/Rate-limiting/Handling-limiting-gracefully)). - Running batch operations in parallel. Often [BatchUpsertRecords](/docs/api#operation/BatchUpsertRecords) is used as part of a user\'s long-running reindex job. A batch of records of size `N` passed to [BatchUpsertRecords](/docs/api#operation/BatchUpsertRecords) is counted as `N` [UpsertRecord](/docs/api#operation/UpsertRecord) calls for the purposes of rate limiting, as opposed to a single call. Treat batch API calls as a convenience rather than a way to get more write throughput.  ## Handling limiting gracefully  A basic technique for integrations to gracefully handle limiting is to watch for `429` HTTP status codes and build in a retry mechanism. The retry mechanism should follow an exponential backoff schedule to reduce request volume when necessary. We also recommend building some randomness into the backoff schedule to avoid a [thundering herd effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem).

/**
 * `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a URL that describes the type of the serialized message.  Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.  Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.      Foo foo = ...;     Any any;     any.PackFrom(foo);     ...     if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {       ...     }  Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.      Foo foo = ...;     Any any = Any.pack(foo);     ...     if (any.is(Foo.class)) {       foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);     }   Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.      foo = Foo(...)     any = Any()     any.Pack(foo)     ...     if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):       any.Unpack(foo)       ...   Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go       foo := &pb.Foo{...}      any, err := anypb.New(foo)      if err != nil {        ...      }      ...      foo := &pb.Foo{}      if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {        ...      }  The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use \'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name\' as the type URL and the unpack methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last \'/\' in the type URL, for example \"foo.bar.com/x/y.z\" will yield type name \"y.z\".   JSON ==== The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:      package google.profile;     message Person {       string first_name = 1;       string last_name = 2;     }      {       \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\",       \"firstName\": <string>,       \"lastName\": <string>     }  If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type` field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):      {       \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\",       \"value\": \"1.212s\"     }
 */
export class ProtobufAny {
  /**
   * A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least one \"/\" character. The last segment of the URL\'s path must represent the fully qualified name of the type (as in `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading \".\" is not accepted).  In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:  * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]   value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the   URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any   lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved   on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage   breaking changes.)  Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with type.googleapis.com.  Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be used with implementation specific semantics.
