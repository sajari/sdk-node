/**
 *  - TYPE_UNSPECIFIED: The default / unset value. The API defaults to `NONE` tracking.  - NONE: No tracking.  - CLICK: Click tracking.  A click token is be generated for each result. Results which do not receive clicks fall down the rankings, and similarly low-ranked records which receive clicks are moved up the rankings.  - POS_NEG: Pos/neg tracking.  Pos/neg tokens are generated for each result. Each record in the result set can be marked with pos/neg value for the search. This is then fed back into the ranking algorithm to improve future results. Unlike `CLICK`, if no tokens are reported for records then no action is taken.  - EVENT: Event tracking.  A query identifier is returned in the [QueryResponse][sajari.v4.QueryResponse] that can be used to link a user interaction to a specific query.
