 *  - NONE: No tracking.  - CLICK: Click tracking.  A click token will be generated for each result.  Results which do not receive clicks will fall down rankings, and similarly low-ranked records which receive clicks will be moved up the rankings.  - POS_NEG: Pos/neg tracking.  Pos/neg tokens will be generated for each result.  Each record in the result set can be marked with pos/neg value for the search.  This is then fed back into the ranking algorithm to improve future results.  Unlike CLICK, if no tokens are reported for records then no action is taken.
